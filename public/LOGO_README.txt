Add your Lamitna logo here as logo.png

1. Save your logo image (the one with لمتنا, moon, lantern, dates, coffee) as:
   public/logo.png

   This file is also used as the browser tab favicon. If you use the same logo
   as in src/assets/lametna.png, copy it here so the tab icon matches.

2. To remove the black background before saving:
   - Use https://remove.bg (upload the image, download result as PNG), or
   - Use any image editor to make the background transparent, then save as PNG.

   If you keep the black background, the site will still hide it on the dark theme using CSS (mix-blend-mode).

3. The logo appears on the home page and auth (sign-in) page. Same file is used when you deploy to Vercel.
